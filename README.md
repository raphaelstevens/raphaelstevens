Hi :wave: 

This repo contains the source code for my [personal page](https://raphaelstevens.netlify.app). I built it as a static website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) open-source generator along with the [Hello Friend NG](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) theme. It is licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

The static pre-rendered nature means minimal server-side processing is required, resulting in faster page loads and lower energy consumption üåç compared to dynamic sites. Source files are hosted & version controlled on [GitHub](https://github.com), and automatically built & deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) infrastructure.

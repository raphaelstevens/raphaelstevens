Hi :wave: 

This is the repo for my [personal website](https://babar.netlify.app) - a static site needing minimal server-side resources. It was built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator and the [Hello Friend NG](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) theme under an [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) open source license. The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com) and the live site is deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

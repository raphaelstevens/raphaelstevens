:wave: Hi 

:computer: This repo contains the source code for [my personal page](https://raphaelstevens.netlify.app). 

:rocket: I built it as a static website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) open-source generator along with the [Hello Friend NG](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) theme.

:earth_africa: The pre-rendered static architecture requires minimal server-side processing, enabling faster page loads, lower energy usage, and reduced carbon footprint compared to dynamic sites. 

:zap: Source files are version controlled on [GitHub](https://github.com) and automatically deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

:memo: The content is authored in Markdown format, allowing for simple and readable source files that get converted to HTML. [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) makes it fast and easy to create and update content.

:balance_scale: The code is licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), excluding proprietary texts and images.

:high_brightness: Dark theme is enabled by default to reduce eye strain, and power consumption on OLED screens. Users can toggle to light mode with the moon icon.

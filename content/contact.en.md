Hi :wave:

Reach me via&nbsp; {{< mail-address-obfuscate mailto="raphael.stevens.public@gmail.com" >}}.
### Readers

Thank you for your feedback and suggestions. I personally read all received messages and do my best to respond.

### Journalists

I am available, in writing or by phone, for interviews and articles directly related to the topics I cover.

I do not comment on breaking news. However, if you need relevant bibliographic resources for your articles, I am happy to share my expertise, off the record.

### Event Organizers

I am regularly invited as an independent speaker and enjoy exchanging ideas with audiences. Thank you for your interest.

As a resident of the Condroz region, I usually limit my travel to Belgium and Northern France, including Paris, but who knows... As a freelancer, I request financial compensation and coverage of transportation, as well as accommodation costs for events abroad. 

### Researchers / Artists

I am open to collaborations with scientists and artists whose work relates to my research topics.

Regarding research, I am motivated by transdisciplinary approaches and happy to share my knowledge on the scientific literature.

On the artistic side, proposals for collaboration at the confluence of arts, sciences and just transition are welcome, especially if they seek to encourage the crossing of perspectives and value the interdependencies between these domains.

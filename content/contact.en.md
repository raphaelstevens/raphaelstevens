Hi :wave:

Reach me via&nbsp; {{< mail-address-obfuscate mailto="raphael.stevens.public@gmail.com" >}}.

### Readers

Thank you for your feedback and suggestions. I personally read all received messages and do my best to respond.

### Journalists

I am available for interviews and articles directly related to the [topics I cover](/en/recherche). Please note that I do not comment on breaking news.

### Event Organizers

I am regularly invited as an independent speaker and enjoy engaging with audiences. Thank you for your interest. 

As a resident of the Condroz region, I usually limit my travel to Belgium and Northern France, including Paris. However, I am open to considering events abroad, provided that financial compensation, transportation, and accommodation costs are covered.

### Researchers / Artists

I'm open to collaborating with scientists and artists whose work aligns with my [research interests](/en/recherche). 

I'm particularly enthusiastic about transdisciplinary approaches and am happy to share my knowledge of the scientific literature.

In terms of artistic collaborations, I'm interested in projects that bring together arts, sciences, and just transition, especially those that encourage the exchange of perspectives and recognize the interconnectedness of these fields

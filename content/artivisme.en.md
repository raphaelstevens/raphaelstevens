title: "Artivism"
---
In times of uncertainty and disruption, it is more crucial than ever to tap into our creativity, emotions, and sensitivities. By forging meaningful connections with the more-than-human world around us, exploring the anxieties and aspirations that traverse humanity, and honing our intuition to detect subtle signals and emerging possibilities, the arts have the potential to precipitate a profound shift in perspective and stimulate our collective imagination.

I endeavour to fulfill a bridging role at the nexus of science, art, and a sustainable transition, bringing together diverse viewpoints for joint reflection. My focus lies in exploring socio-ecological artivism through curating exhibitions. By artivism, I refer to creative mediums and initiatives that encourage active engagement, with the ultimate goal of transforming people's relationship with time and space, and motivating urgent action.

***[The overview effect](https://www.bozar.be/fr/calendrier/tendencies-19)***, April 27 - June 9, 2019, Bozar Center for Fine Arts, Brussels. 
>Exhibition as part of the 4th edition of TENDENCIES, a series aiming to encourage "the exchange of ideas between contemporary arts and sciences in the digital age". The title refers to the non-aligned art movement [Nove tendencije]https://www.hisour.com/fr/nouvelle-tendance-21624/) that emerged in the 1960s in Zagreb, one of the first international groups to explore "[art as research](https://www.tingenesmetode.no/images/PDF/Litteratur_MK/Bjerregaard_Introduction.pdf)". The overview effect [[catalogue](/img/overview-effect.pdf)] brought together sound and visual installations by six artists, Marjolijn Dijkman, Jerry Galle, Mikkel Rørbo, Kris Verdonck, Pierre Jean Giloux and the SEAD collective, to explore our relationship to dystopian and utopian futures in the age of artificial intelligence (AI).

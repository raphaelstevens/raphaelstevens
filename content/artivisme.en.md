In our era of uncertainty and change, creativity, emotion, and sensitivity are more vital than ever. By deepening our connection to the world beyond humanity, exploring our shared anxieties and aspirations, and sharpening our intuition to perceive subtle signals and emerging possibilities, art can catalyze a profound shift in perspective and ignite our collective imagination.

I strive to bridge the realms of science, art, and sustainable transition, fostering dialogue among diverse viewpoints. My work centers on socio-ecological artivism through curated exhibitions. Artivism, as I define it, encompasses creative mediums and initiatives that inspire active engagement, aiming to transform our relationship with time and space while spurring urgent action.

***[The overview effect](https://www.bozar.be/fr/calendrier/tendencies-19)***, April 27 - June 9, 2019, Bozar Center for Fine Arts, Brussels. 
>Exhibition as part of the 4th edition of TENDENCIES, a series aiming to encourage "the exchange of ideas between contemporary arts and sciences in the digital age". The title refers to the non-aligned art movement [Nove tendencije]https://www.hisour.com/fr/nouvelle-tendance-21624/) that emerged in the 1960s in Zagreb, one of the first international groups to explore "[art as research](https://www.tingenesmetode.no/images/PDF/Litteratur_MK/Bjerregaard_Introduction.pdf)". The overview effect [[catalogue](/img/overview-effect.pdf)] brought together sound and visual installations by six artists, Marjolijn Dijkman, Jerry Galle, Mikkel Rørbo, Kris Verdonck, Pierre Jean Giloux and the SEAD collective, to explore our relationship to dystopian and utopian futures in the age of artificial intelligence (AI).

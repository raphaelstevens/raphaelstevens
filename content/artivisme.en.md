title: "Artivism"
---
Facing the uncertainties and ruptures of our time, it is more necessary than ever to connect with our creativity, emotions, and sensitivities. Weaving sensitive bonds with the more-than-human world around us, sounding out the fears and hopes traversing humanity, developing our intuition to discern weak signals and emerging possibilities: the arts play a crucial role in shifting perspectives and stimulating our collective imagination.

I involve myself in a bridging role at the intersections of sciences, arts and a just transition, to bring together perspectives around joint reflection. I specifically explore socio-ecological artivism through curating exhibitions. By artivism I mean forms of engaged art that disrupt our relationship with time and space, and could accelerate our passage to action.

*[The overview effect](https://www.bozar.be/fr/calendrier/tendencies-19)*, April 27 - June 9, 2019,, Bozar Center for Fine Arts, Brussels. 
>Exhibition as part of the 4th edition of TENDENCIES, a series aiming to encourage "the exchange of ideas between contemporary arts and sciences in the digital age". The title refers to the non-aligned art movement [Nove tendencije]https://www.hisour.com/fr/nouvelle-tendance-21624/) that emerged in the 1960s in Zagreb, one of the first international groups to explore "[art as research](https://www.tingenesmetode.no/images/PDF/Litteratur_MK/Bjerregaard_Introduction.pdf)". The overview effect [[catalogue](/img/overview-effect.pdf)] brought together sound and visual installations by six artists, Marjolijn Dijkman, Jerry Galle, Mikkel Rørbo, Kris Verdonck, Pierre Jean Giloux and the SEAD collective, to explore our relationship to dystopian and utopian futures in the age of artificial intelligence (AI).

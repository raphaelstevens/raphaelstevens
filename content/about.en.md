I began nearly twenty years ago with an experience as an environmental policy advisor at the [International Polar Foundation](https://www.polarfoundation.org/). At the time, few solutions were proposed to address climate change and the overexploitation of natural resources. So in 2005, I initiated [Greenloop](https://www.greenloop.eu/), a consulting agency specialized in circular, sustainable and low-carbon strategies, and co-founded the [Biomimicry Europa](https://www.biomimicry.eu/) association to promote [biomimicry](https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/biomimetisme). With degrees in Business, and in Environmental Management, I also received training in the [Bilan Carbone&reg;](https://bilans-ges.ademe.fr/) method which I pioneered in Belgium.

A few years later, the 2008-2009 financial crisis heavily impacted the budgets allocated by companies and public authorities for the transition, leading to the abandonment of several of our projects or their transformation into simple publicity stunts. This episode revealed to me the limits incrementalism in a "overshoot" situation, and the imperative to devise options beyond mainstream economic paradigms. So I left the management of Greenloop to follow a Master of Science (MSc) co-organized by the [Schumacher College](https://campus.dartington.org/schumacher-college/) and the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the [University of Plymouth](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/schools-of-geography-earth-and-environmental-sciences). Stepping back allowed me to explore [complexity sciences](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/7/1/4/htm), [Earth system science](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-019-0005-6), philosophy and history of science. My thesis focused on developing a tool that envisions resilience in a [holonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)) form to better understand the interactions between its drivers and barriers. During this period, I also began studying the literature on global systemic risks and collapse [[bibliography]](https://collapsologie.info/en/science).

Independent for ten years, and now a research associate at the [Momentum Institute](https://institutmomentum.org/), I [write](publications.fr.md) articles for magazines such as [Imagine Demain le Monde](https://www.imagine-magazine.com/) and popular science books such as [_How Everything Can Collapse_](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/How+Everything+Can+Collapse%3A+A+Manual+for+our+Times-p-9781509541393) and [_Another End of the World is Possible_](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Another+End+of+the+World+is+Possible%3A+Living+the+Collapse+%28and+Not+Merely+Surviving+It%29-p-9781509544677) (with [Pablo Servigne](https://pabloservigne.com/) and [Gauthier Chapelle](https://www.babelio.com/auteur/Gauthier-Chapelle/86103)), translated into ten languages. I also give public lectures and offer trainings at the [Eco-Conseil Institute](https://www.eco-conseil.be/). And sometimes, I curate or contribute to exhibitions like those at the [Bozar Center for Fine Arts](https://www.bozar.be/en/calendar/tendencies-19) in Brussels and at the [Espacio Fundación Telefónica](https://normalfutu.re/uncategorized/grasias-the-good-collapse-exhibition/) in Madrid.

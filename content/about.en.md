As an essayist for the past decade and a fellow researcher at the [Momentum Institute](https://institutmomentum.org/), I [publish](/en/publications) prospective analyses on issues of transition, resilience, global systemic risks, and collapse in popular science books and articles. I give public lectures and offer training sessions, and workshops, often at the [Institut Eco-Conseil](https://www.eco-conseil.be/) (Belgium). Concurrently, I explore socio-ecological [artivism(/en/artivism) through organizing exhibitions like the one I curated at the [Bozar Center for Fine Arts](https://www.bozar.be/en/calendar/tendencies-19) in Brussels or the one I participated in at the [Espacio Fundación Telefónica](https://normalfutu.re/uncategorized/grasias-the-good-collapse-exhibition/) in Madrid.

With a degree in business and eco-counselling, I began as an environmental policy advisor for the [International Polar Foundation](https://www.polarfoundation.org/) in the early 2000s. At that time, few solutions existed to address climate change and the exploitation of natural resources. Consequently, in 2005, I initiated [Greenloop](https://www.greenloop.eu/), a consulting agency specializing in circular and low-carbon strategies, as well as [Biomimicry Europa](https://www.biomimicry.eu/), an association dedicated to promoting bioinspired and sustainable solutions.

The financial crisis of 2008-2009 then revealed the limitations of a "small steps" approach, leading to the abandonment of numerous projects. Convinced of the need to rethink dominant economic models, I left Greenloop to pursue a Master of Science (MSc) jointly organized by the [Schumacher College](https://campus.dartington.org/schumacher-college/) and the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the [University of Plymouth](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/schools-of-geography-earth-and-environmental-sciences). This training allowed me to explore [complexity sciences](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/7/1/4/htm), [Earth system science](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-019-0005-6), philosophy, and the history of science. My dissertation focused on a tool that envisioned resilience in a holonic form. 
It was also during this period that I began to delve into the expansive field of studies on societal collapse and the potential "end of the world as we know it" scenarios, collaborating closely with my friends and colleagues [Pablo Servigne](https://pabloservigne.com) and [Gauthier Chapelle](https://www.babelio.com/auteur/Gauthier-Chapelle/86103).

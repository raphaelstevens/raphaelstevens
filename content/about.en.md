As an essayist and researcher at the [Momentum Institute](https://institutmomentum.org/) for the past decade, I [focus](/en/publications) on resilience, global systemic risks, societal collapse, intuition and post-normal science. My work appears in popular science books and articles, and I frequently deliver public lectures and training sessions, including workshops at the [Institut Eco-Conseil](https://www.eco-conseil.be/) in Belgium. Additionally, I explore socio-ecological [artivism](/en/artivisme) through curating exhibitions, such as those at the [Bozar Center for Fine Arts](https://www.bozar.be/en/calendar/tendencies-19) in Brussels and the [Espacio Fundación Telefónica](https://normalfutu.re/uncategorized/grasias-the-good-collapse-exhibition/) in Madrid.

My career began in the early 2000s as an environmental policy advisor for the International Polar Foundation, following my education in business and eco-counselling. Recognizing the scarcity of solutions addressing climate change and resource exploitation, I co-founded [Greenloop](https://www.greenloop.eu/) in 2005, a consulting agency specializing in circular and low-carbon strategies. Concurrently, I co-established [Biomimicry Europa](https://www.biomimicry.eu/) to promote bioinspired, sustainable solutions.

The 2008-2009 financial crisis exposed the limitations of incremental approaches, leading to the abandonment of numerous projects. This realization prompted me to leave Greenloop and pursue an MSc jointly offered by [Schumacher College](https://campus.dartington.org/schumacher-college/) and the[University of Plymouth](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/schools-of-geography-earth-and-environmental-sciences)'s School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences. This program deepened my understanding of [complexity sciences](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/7/1/4/htm), [Earth system science](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-019-0005-6), philosophy, and the history of science. My dissertation explored a holonic approach to resilience. During this period, I also began investigating the growing field of societal collapse studies and "end of the world as we know it" scenarios, collaborating closely with colleagues [Pablo Servigne](https://pabloservigne.com) and [Gauthier Chapelle](https://www.babelio.com/auteur/Gauthier-Chapelle/86103).

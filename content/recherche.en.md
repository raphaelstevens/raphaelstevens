The challenges we face today, unprecedented in scale, complexity and potentially catastrophic risks, defy compartmentalised analytical frameworks and require mobilising diverse perspectives.

With this in mind, my work centres on several interconnected, forward-looking themes: [Collapsology](#collapsology), [resilience](#resilience), [intuition](#intuition) & [post-normal science](#post-normal-science). The aim is to better grasp the vulnerabilities and tipping points that threaten society, as well as the conditions and levers for transformation that could boost our capacities for anticipation and adaptation.

### Collapsology

> *Transdisciplinary study of collapse risks and dynamics*

The accelerating decline of biodiversity, the multiplication of extreme weather events, the intensification of geopolitical and resource tensions, rising inequality, persisting armed conflicts, and the resurgence of epidemics â€“ the interaction of these dynamics threatens the very stability of humanity's future. Irreversible social and environmental collapses are already unfolding, while others appear imminent. Researchers across various disciplines now describe scenarios where civilization, or even our species' existence, is at risk. Serious foresight must confront these challenges head-on.

The complexity of these interconnected challenges stems from critical tipping points and feedback loops, resulting in cascading and synchronous system failures, all set against a backdrop of radical uncertainty. The scientific literature sheds light on the polymorphic nature of these systemic "wicked problems," arising from the convergence of multiple risk factors. Adopting holistic, Earth system perspectives is essential to elucidate the thresholds, nonlinearities, and interdependencies at play. By doing so, we can gain a deeper comprehension of this complex risk landscape, enabling us to envision resilience pathways and adaptations commensurate to the scale of the looming challenges. [collapsology].

It's also crucial to consider the role of emotions and spirituality in all of this, and to seek new ways of finding meaning and reconnecting with nature around us, in order to weather the storms that lie ahead  [collapsosophy]. Moreover, we must address the political stakes and determine what needs to be done, how, and with whom, in order to tackle these challenges head-on [collapsopraxis].

I share my bibliography on these topics via [collapsologie.info](https://www.collapsologie.info/en/science).

### Resilience

> *Capacity to withstand shocks and transform*

When disasters strike a region, not all communities display the same resilience. Where does this "rebound capacity" come from? My interest focuses on two key factors: social memory and bonding, bridging and linking social capital.

My approach is grounded in a transformative conception of resilience centered on local populations, their needs and their own aspirations, while taking into account the power relations and inequalities.

Through sharing experiences, commemorations, or mutual-aid, resilient communities draw on their "social capital" to rebuild. The goal is to better understand the drivers of this emergent property. But also to consider how public authorities and citizen collectives can nurture it.

### Intuition

> *A faculty complementary to reason and indispensable for strengthening our anticipatory capacities*

Intuition is far more than just a secondary cognitive mode. It's a faculty that can help us make unexpected associations and perceive imperceptible signals in an increasingly complex world. Research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience shows, for example, the crucial role of intuition in decision-making in VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) environments. By connecting disparate pieces of information lodged in our associative memory, intuition gives rise to new ideas and pushes the boundaries of creativity. It can be an asset to enhance our capacities for anticipation and adaptation, and sharpen our perception of possible futures.

For nearly four centuries, we've cultivated analytical and rational thinking on a collective scale. What if we did the same for intuition? This wouldn't be about subtracting the former faculty for the benefit of the latter, but about combining their strengths (and recognizing their weaknesses). From this perspective, intuitive thought, its role in a group, and the means to socially valorize it appear as an underexplored research area. The idea is to design and set-up experiments to investigate these questions.

### Post-normal science

> *A scientific approach adapted to the complexity of 21st century challenges*

Post-normal science provides the general framework for my approach. In the face of contemporary challenges' complexity, it advocates for transdisciplinary and socially engaged approaches, such as participatory action research. This concept emerged in the 1990s to overcome the limitations of conventional scientific approaches on problems characterized by deep uncertainty and a plurality of worldviews. From this perspective, the scientific process involves considering the views of scientists in governing contemporary risks, as well as experts, decision-makers, and civil society, by valuing traditional knowledge and perspectives from diverse cultures.

By embracing the subjective nature of knowledge and the importance of values in decision-making, post-normal science encourages a more holistic and reflexive approach to science, one that is better equipped to tackle the wicked problems we face today.

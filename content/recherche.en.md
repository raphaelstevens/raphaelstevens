Today's challenges are unprecedented in their magnitude, interconnectedness, and potentially catastrophic nature. They defy compartmentalized analytical frameworks and require the mobilization of diverse perspectives. 

With this in mind, my work focuses on several interrelated, forward-looking themes: [Collapsology](#collapsology), [resilience](#resilience), [intuition](#intuition) & [post-normal science](#post-normal-science). The aim is to better understand the vulnerabilities and tipping points that threaten societies and the biosphere, as well as the conditions and levers for transformation that could enhance our ability to anticipate and adapt.

### Collapsology

> *Transdisciplinary study of collapse risks and dynamics*

The accelerating decline of biodiversity, the multiplication of extreme weather events, the intensification of geopolitical and resource tensions, rising inequality, persisting armed conflicts, and the resurgence of epidemics – The interplay of these dynamics is destabilizing societies and the biosphere. Some irreversible social and environmental collapses are already underway, while others loom on the horizon. Researchers across disciplines now outline scenarios where our civilization – or even our species' existence – is at risk. Responsible foresight must confront these challenges head-on.

The complexity of these interconnected challenges stems from critical tipping points and potentially irreversible feedback loops. Our interconnected systems face risks of cascading or synchronous failures, set against a backdrop of radical uncertainty. Scientific literature highlights the polymorphic nature of these wicked problems and the confluence of multiple risk factors (compound risks). It is essential to adopt systems thinking to grasp the thresholds, nonlinearities, and interdependencies at play. By doing so, we can gain a deeper comprehension of this complex risk landscape, enabling us to envision responses commensurate to the scale of the looming challenges [collapsology].

It's equally crucial to examine the role of emotions and spirituality in this debate, as well as to seek new ways of finding meaning and renew our relationship with the more-than-human world, as we navigate these storms [collapsosophy]. Political issues must also be addressed to determine what needs to be done, how to do it, and with whom [collapsopraxis].

I share my bibliography on these topics via [collapsologie.info](https://www.collapsologie.info/en/science).

### Resilience

> *Capacity to withstand shocks and transform*

When disasters strike a region, not all communities display the same resilience. Where does this "rebound capacity" come from? My interest focuses on two key factors: social memory and bonding, bridging and linking social capital.

My approach is grounded in a transformative conception of resilience which focus on local populations, their needs and their own aspirations, while taking into account power relations and inequalities.

Through sharing experiences, commemorations, or mutual-aid, resilient communities draw on their "social capital" to rebuild. The goal is to better understand the drivers of this emergent property. But also to consider how public authorities and citizen collectives can nurture it.

### Intuition

> *A faculty complementary to reason and indispensable for strengthening our anticipatory capacities*

Intuition is far more than a secondary cognitive mode. It's a powerful ability that helps us make unexpected connections and detect subtle signals in our increasingly complex world. Research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience highlights intuition's crucial role in decision-making, especially in VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) environments. 

By linking disparate pieces of information stored in our associative memory, intuition sparks new ideas and expands our creative boundaries. It can be a valuable asset in enhancing our capacity for anticipation and adaptation, sharpening our perception of possible futures.

For nearly four centuries, we've cultivated analytical and rational thinking on a societal scale. What if we applied the same effort to developing intuition? The goal isn't to replace rational thought with intuitive processes, but to combine their strengths (while acknowledging their limitations).

From this perspective, intuitive thought, its role in group dynamics, and methods to socially validate it emerge as an underexplored area of research. The next step is to design and conduct experiments to investigate these questions further.

### Post-normal science

> *A scientific approach adapted to the complexity of 21st century challenges*

Post-normal science provides the overarching framework for my approach. In the face of today's complex challenges, it advocates for transdisciplinary and socially engaged methodologies, such as participatory action research.
This concept emerged in the 1990s as a response to the limitations of conventional scientific approaches when dealing with problems characterized by deep uncertainty and a plurality of worldviews. 

From this perspective, the scientific process expands to include not only the views of scientists but also those of experts, decision-makers, and civil society. It values traditional knowledge and diverse cultural perspectives in governing contemporary risks.

Post-normal science embraces the subjective nature of knowledge and recognizes the importance of values in decision-making. This approach encourages a more holistic and reflexive scientific practice, one better equipped to tackle the "wicked problems" we face today.
